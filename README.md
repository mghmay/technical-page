# Holy CSS documentation, Batman!

## Spec

Well, it's documentation so it has to be that nice blueprint blue, doesn't it? This was one of the projects for my Free Code Camp course in responsive web design.

## Nifty things

I like the overall look of the webpage and it is w3c accessibilty approved.

## To be improved

It's a fairly basic design layout with the nav bar on the side. If i were to do it again i would set it up as a full website with different pages.
